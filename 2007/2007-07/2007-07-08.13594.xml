      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;At their meeting in Beijing today, the Head of the Federal Department of Economic Affairs and the Chinese Minister of Commerce have decided to conduct internal feasibility studies towards a possible free trade agreement. These studies will show whether the conditions are in place for a free trade agreement between the two countries at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two ministers have also decided to bolster the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) by setting up a regular dialogue through a working group consisting of representatives of their administrations and industry or business associations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mandate of the working group is to find solutions, advance dialogue on institutional and legislative aspects of IPR and their enforcement. Switzerland and China also reaffirmed their reciprocal obligations under the WTO agreement on Trade related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ministers have also decided to set up a bilateral working group to promote investment. This working group will have the goal of assisting Swiss business to invest in China and of attracting Chinese investors in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
