      <text link="no">A U.S.-Switzerland panel discussion on the theme of «Balancing Global Competition and National Regulation» took place on January 27 as part of the WEF program in Davos. It was organised in conjunction with the World Economic Forum, jointly by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (seco), the U.S. Embassy in Switzerland, economiesuisse (the Swiss Business Federation) and the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Joseph Deiss, Swiss Federal Councillor and Head of the Department of Economic Affairs, and Michael K. Powell, Chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, provided government perspectives to the discussion. The corporate views were presented by Brian Henderson, Vice Chairman of Merrill Lynch for Europe, Middle East and Africa; Walter B. Kielholz, Chairman of the Board of Credit Suisse Group; André Kudelski, President and CEO of the Kudelski Group; and Michael D. White, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo International. Olivier Fleurot, CEO of The Financial Times, acted as the panel’s moderator.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The panelists discussed the challenge of reconciling some key objectives of global companies with the political imperatives of national regulation. The need for a strengthened dialogue between the private sector and local political authorities was emphasized. Several panellists called for enhanced co-operation, inter alia through international agreements as a way to address the major issues identified.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The U.S.-Switzerland Joint Economic Commission (JEC) is designed to involve government and business leaders from both countries in co-operating on joint projects that promote stability in the global economy and strengthening the two countries' political dialogue and economic partnership.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 27 January 2005&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;For further Information:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; State Secretariat for Economic Affairs(SECO)&lt;br /&gt; Mr. Philippe Nell&lt;br /&gt; Effingerstrasse 27&lt;br /&gt; 3003 Berne&lt;br /&gt; Phone: +41 (0)31 322 23 27&lt;br /&gt; Fax:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; +41 (0)31 325 73 61&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;philippe.nell@seco.admin.ch&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; US Embassy&lt;br /&gt; Press&lt;br /&gt; Mr. Dan Wendell&lt;br /&gt; Jubiläumsstrasse 9&lt;br /&gt; 33001 Berne&lt;br /&gt; Phone: +41 (0)31 357 72 48&lt;br /&gt; Fax:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; +41 (0)31 357 73 44&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;http://www.usembassy.ch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</text>
