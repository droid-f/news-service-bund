      <lead>Ministers from some 30 Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) representing a broad spectrum of negotiating positions gathered for an informal meeting in Davos on 27 and 28 January on the fringes of the World Economic Forum (WEF).</lead>
      <text link="no">The meeting was hosted by Federal Councillor Joseph Deiss, Swiss Minister of Economic Affairs. Ministers took stock of the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and reiterated their commitment to the objectives agreed in Doha and Hong Kong. They addressed the necessary decisions to be made to drive the Doha Round to a successful conclusion in 2006. In particular, they looked into the practical steps negotiating groups should take to meet the deadlines set in Hong Kong. Ministers agreed to promptly step up their efforts with a view to bridging divergences. They stand ready to get involved whenever necessary to solve outstanding issues requiring political decisions. Ministers also acknowledged that progress should be made in all areas to reach an balanced overall outcome.</text>
