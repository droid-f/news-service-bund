      <title>G10 Press Statement</title>
      <lead>Ministers of the G10 have met in Davos today prior to an informal WTO Ministerial gathering organised by Switzerland on the occasion of the World Economic Forum 2013 in order to assess the state of play of the work at the WTO and their priorities in the negotiations on agriculture.</lead>
      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;They highlighted that G10 Members have always shown a constructive engagement and a proactive role in trying to achieve a reasonable balance between liberalizing agricultural markets and the need to accommodate Members' specific domestic situation and concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G10 Ministers reiterated their commitment to a successful conclusion of the Doha Round, but acknowledged that in line with paragraph 47 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration possible areas where progress can be achieved should be identified with a view to implement them at an earlier stage. Ministers emphasized, however, that possible "deliverables" based on progress achieved in the Doha Round cannot be identified predominantly in the area of agriculture; a balance with other issues is necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noted that the multilateral trading system has a role to play in addressing global food security and underlined that a clarification and strengthening of WTO disciplines on export prohibitions and restrictions would increase assurance to Members about their ability to access foodstuffs and feeds in world markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G10 Ministers renewed their determination to engage and work constructively with all other Members to advance the work at the WTO.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
