      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;Following the decision to resume WTO negotiations on 16 November 2006,&amp;nbsp; technical discussions intensified in Geneva. The aim of the meeting in Davos, which was also attended by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, was to take stock of the stand of the negotiations and&amp;nbsp; to exchange ideas on how best to advance the process of the Doha Round negotiations. The meeting was held on the morning of Saturday, 27 January 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The participants underlined the need of a more comprehensive approach to negotiations and shared the view that an inclusive process that allows for all sensitivities to be expressed represents the best way of achieving a successful outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They expressed a strong wish for a quick resumption of full-scale activity in Geneva and discussed the prerequisites for taking advantage of the window opportunity for making substantial progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clear signal for the resumption of full scale negotiations in Geneva got strong support from political leaders and the business community gathered in Davos&lt;/p&gt;</text>
