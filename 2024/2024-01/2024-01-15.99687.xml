      <title>Press communiqué of the co-chairs Ukraine and Switzerland of the 4th Meeting of National Security and Foreign Policy Advisors on Key Principles of Peace for Ukraine</title>
      <lead>Davos, Switzerland, 14 January 2024</lead>
      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;Today in Davos, Switzerland, the international consultations on key principles of peace for Ukraine took place. The consultations included in-person and online participation of national security and foreign policy advisors from 82 countries and international organisations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting is a continuation of the meetings in Copenhagen on 24th June 2023, Jeddah on 5th August 2023, and Malta on 28th October 2023. The goal of this and previous meetings is to elaborate a unified and joint approach on how to end the war against Ukraine with a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, and to develop measures to overcome the regional and global consequences of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Participants expressed deep gratitude to the Swiss Confederation for its exquisite hospitality and organization of the fourth round of consultations on the key principles of peace. The meeting in Switzerland is symbolic, as this country has always been devoted to the principles of international law. It was in Geneva, Switzerland, that the international community adopted a number of conventions on human treatment during war, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the Protection of War Victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting of advisors is taking place on the 690th day since the beginning of the unprovoked full-scale invasion on Ukraine by the Russian Federation. The brutal war against Ukraine has been lasting on for almost two years and is accompanied by constant mass attacks on the civilian and critical infrastructure of Ukraine and its population. Only recent missiles and drones attacks on the largest cities of Ukraine took the lives of several dozen Ukrainian civilians, which certainly shall be strongly condemned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was emphasized that Ukraine's security is an integral part of world and regional security, therefore war against Ukraine remains one of the main destabilizing factors for security in the world. Due to this, peace efforts must be significantly strengthened in order to end the war in a just and comprehensive way. The task of the world community shall not only be to end the war, but also to overcome the consequences of all those crises that were caused by it throughout the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an open and constructive meeting, in which it was discussed in details the key principles, on which a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine and the whole world should be built. Such peace can only be based on the UN Charter, the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the key principles of international law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this high-level meeting, continuing the detailed discussions in Malta, the reports on the implementation of action plans in the following directions for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace were discussed: “Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities”, “Restoration of justice”, "Environmental safety", “Preventing escalation and repetition of aggression”, and “Confirmation of the end of the war”. Special discussion panels were dedicated to the aspects of food security and humanitarian aspects of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meeting laid the necessary prerequisites for the preparation of a meeting of leaders of states and governments, which can give a start at a high level to establish a common and universal basis for achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine based on the Ukrainian Peace Formula. The leaders’ meeting may also give a start to the set of thematic meetings in different countries at the ministerial, parliamentary, expert and other levels to prepare detailed proposals for the leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;National security and foreign policy advisors will continue to work closely together to ensure the broadest possible international support for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace for Ukraine and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This communiqué is not intended to reflect the views of all participants.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
