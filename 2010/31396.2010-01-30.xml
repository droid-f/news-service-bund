      <title>WTO Ministers prepare for progress in the Doha Trade Round</title>
      <teaser>At the invitation of the President of the Swiss Confederation, Doris Leuthard, 17 Ministers in charge of WTO affairs as well as WTO Director General Pascal Lamy met in Davos, Switzerland, today. The purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on where we stand in the Doha Round and what is needed to progress.</teaser>
      <lead>At the invitation of the President of the Swiss Confederation, Doris Leuthard, 17 Ministers in charge of WTO affairs as well as WTO Director General Pascal Lamy met in Davos, Switzerland, today. The purpose of the meeting was to exchange views on where we stand in the Doha Round and what is needed to progress.</lead>
      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;The discussion between Ministers has shown, that there is no alternative then to continue the engagement of WTO-Members for concluding the round. The opening-up of markets is the best countries can do to fight the crisis, to better stabilize their budgets and to contribute to the recovery of the global economy. This in turn will induce overall job creation. The conclusion of the Doha Round would be a strong common multilateral effort to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some Ministers were of the view that Leaders should also engage in the negotiation process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Ministers underlined, that the rules-based multilateral trading system helped to avoid large-scale protectionism in the economic difficult times. This high value of the rules-based system is not always sufficiently stressed. WTO Members shall continue their efforts to resist protectionist pressures at home and the WTO shall continue to monitor all new measures.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
