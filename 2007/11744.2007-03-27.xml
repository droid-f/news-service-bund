      <title>At the conclusion of 10th session of the Swiss-India Joint Economic Commission</title>
      <lead>The 10th Meeting of the Swiss India Joint Economic Commission (JEC) took place in Grindelwald (Switzerland) on 26 March 2007. The Swiss delegation was led by Ambassador Monika Rühl Burzi, Head of Bilateral Economic Relations, State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), Government of Switzerland and the Indian delegation was led by Mr. O.P. Arya, Additional Secretary, Department of Commerce, Government of India. Representatives of Swiss business and industry also participated in the discussions.</lead>
      <text link="no">&lt;p&gt;The JEC noted with satisfaction the positive development in the bilateral economic relationship and reiterated their commitment to further enhance bilateral trade in view of the huge potential for widening and deepening the trade basket. The sustained economic growth in India presents an attractive opportunity to Swiss business to make investments in various sectors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The delegations welcomed the initiative for setting up an India-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Joint Study Group to explore the feasability of a broad-based trade and investment agreement between India and EFTA. It was noted that the first meeting of the India-EFTA Joint Study Group is scheduled to take place in April 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both sides exchanged views on regional and multilateral issues of mutual concern including the present position of the Doha Round. Both sides expressed their commitment to a rules based multilateral trading system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2008 marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Indo-Swiss Treaty of Friendship. This would be an opportune time to organise a series of promotional events and programmes in India as well as Switzerland with a focus on strengthening the bilateral economic relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discussions in the JEC covered cooperation in areas such as Intellectual Property Rights, science and technology, organic products, food processing, Air Services Agreement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in the area of Intellectual Property Rights and Geographical Indications by establishing a formal structure through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate dialogue between experts on both sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JEC took note of the excellent cooperation in the science and technology sector and welcomed the forthcoming visit of a Swiss delegation led by State Secretary for Science, Education and Research to India in April 2007 to take forward this cooperation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JEC noted with satisfaction the existing cooperation and progress made in the areas of organic agricultural and marine products and agreed to explore the possibilities of enhancing cooperation in the food processing sector covering technological as well as infrastructure aspects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JEC identified information technology and tourism sectors as having potential for larger bilateral economic flows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bilateral economic engagement will receive a further impetus by business to business&amp;nbsp; contacts during the Swiss Forum for International Business to be held on March 27-28 in Zurich, with India as the focus country. The Swiss Minister of Economy, Federal Councillor, Doris Leuthard, and the Indian Minister of Commerce &amp;amp; Industry, Mr. Kamal Nath will be participating in the event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed that henceforth the JEC shall meet annually. The next meeting will be held in New Delhi in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
